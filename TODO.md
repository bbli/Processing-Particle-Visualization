## Plan
### One Title
* check constructors
* optionally show each title
    * Change font

* get better font
* add knob that gets value of circulation level
* add slider to control time?? I seem to have issues with this. need to wait for equilibrium
* cp4 textArea/textLabel to be invariant of rotatation?

* dropdown/scrollable/buttonBar mode(cp5 dropdownList)
* on/off(or bang) button (cp5 background)
* can wrap all buttons in a cp5 group


* calculate time diff regular mean too
#### DONE
* Be ok with not being able to extract any insight from my project
* change velocity flow field to acceleration flow field, so particles can gain momentum
    * **THINK about how max speed will change my visualization**-> well speed is just for visual effects, so no problem with data mapping
* counter to decide how often to change the flowfield-> nah can just change frameRate
* lets not map the supplies, since its mostly above 90 percent
* Create mode to combine the "eyes" lol -> This can be done at the same time as just showing one of them
    * the **text can't be hardcoded then, or I need to rewrite the text**, which is not that bad I guess
### Multiple Titles
* define parameters that will allow you to hide the others and change camera view
* compare two side by side
