* add lifetime as part of the Particle constructor
* Check iterator code with Nature of Code
* check it python iterator also makes sure you loop over everything once

* Delete particles when they get sucked out
* move box_size back into Flock constructor and into main/FlockSystem
* change hardcoding of initial position of particles
## Plan
1. Create and visualize hurrican+perlin noise flow field
