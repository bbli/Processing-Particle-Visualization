* move box_size back into Flock constructor and into main/FlockSystem
* change hardcoding of initial position of particles
## Plan
### One Title
* change velocity flow field to acceleration flow field, so particles can gain momentum
    * **THINK about how max speed will change my visualization**

* calculate time diff regular mean too
* counter to decide how often to change the flowfield

* Make initial points to random points on a sphere?? 

### Multiple Titles
* Create flock objects for dataset to load into
* Put on a square
* define parameters that will allow you to hide the others and change camera view
